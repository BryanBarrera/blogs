# Predictable SVGs: Knowing just enough XML

## We ‚ù§Ô∏è SVGs but maybe you only __tolerate__ XML üëÄ

This past year, I had the chance to start maintaining our own SVG icon library so I had to start learning how to do things with XML.
You can do a lot with SVGs but for our users at work, we only have a few requirements for our icons:

1. Be SVGs.
2. Change color with HTML/CSS.
3. Change size with HTML/CSS. 

That's it.

I discovered that I only needed to care about 3 XML things to meet all of our requirements: 

- `fill`, 
- `viewBox`, 
- `width` and `height`.

Before we talk about those 3 XML things, let's talk about XML just so we're on the same page.

## XML

This is XML for an SVG. This code tells the browser to draw a red circle:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

It looks a lot like HTML, right?
They resemble each other because HTML and XML are both Markup Languages.
- XML is used for data.
- HTML is used to create structure for websites and apps.

In fact, you can take this XML and put it directly in your HTML file and it will display.

```html
<html>
<body>
	<!-- We call this "inline SVG" because it's in the lines (#dadjokes) -->
  <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red" />
  </svg>
</body>
</html>
```

This is one of the best ways to include SVGs on your website or app especially when the SVG XML is small and simple.
In most cases, you can treat it like HTML with a few exceptions. One commone exception is adding color to your SVG.

## Fill

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="100" height="100">
	<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

### SVG Tags and Attributes

In both XML and HTML:
- Tags (aka Elements) are the things with `<>`
- Attributes help customize Tags through description, naming or behavior.

### Fill

This is the easiest one to understand and here's all you need to know for now:

The `fill` attribute sets the color of the SVG.
- Uses any CSS color values (hexcodes, names, etc.)
- Can be applied to the `<svg>` or different shapes inside the `<svg>` like, `<circle>`, etc.

### ViewBox

The `viewBox` attribute controls the parts of the SVG you actually see. The viewable stuff. viewBox!
It almost works like a __moveable, resizable window__.
- A "window" that is too small will show a small part of the SVG.
- A "window" that is too big will show the entire SVG and scale it accordingly.
- A "window" that is sized and positioned _just_ right...well, it shows the entire SVG; no more and no less.

For my own humble requirements at work, keeping these three attributes together helps a lot. Now here's how we can think about them together.

### Here's what _seems_ to happen...

Let's start with the `<svg>` wrapping element.

```html
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  ...
</svg>
```

Get ready for some air quotes. 

We can control "sizing" with `width` and `height`. 

- You can override these attribtue values with CSS
- The SVG will keep its aspect ratio intact, so you won't see any weird stretching or shrinking when you do weird size changes. 

We can control the "parts of the SVG you actually see" with `viewBox`.

- `viewBox` is like defining the size and position of a "window" to view the SVG icon. For example:
	- A "window" that is too small will show a small part of the SVG.
	- A "window" that is too big will show the entire SVG and some of the background it's on.
	- A "window" that is sized and positioned _just_ right...well, it shows the entire SVG; no more and no less.

**Bottom line**: Make sure these attributes are always present and they should always match.

### But, what's _actually_ happening?

Okay...now for the truthy bits.

Width and height control the **viewport** of the SVG. You can see what I mean when the `viewBox` is removed. Notice how increasing the width and height of the SVG doesn't actually make the SVG bigger?
